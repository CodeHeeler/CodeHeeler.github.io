              My love for learning all things, especially science, was cultivated
              at a very early age, and I was especially lucky to have parents who
              supported and nourished that learning.  Not everyone is so privileged,
              and thus I would like to help kids to gain a love for learning to
              code through camps and community projects to better prepare them for
              a career path in STEM, should they choose to pursue one.
              To that end, I'm currently looking into area groups that teach through
              the Raspberry Pi but am certainly open to other ideas.
              <br><br>
              Learning continues at all ages, whether that's for a career change
              as was the case for me, adding new languages and skills, or even just
              working on a fun hobby project.  Finding resources has never been
              easier with internet searches and videos at your fingertips, but
              there's still great value in attending Meetup groups in your area
              and connecting to other coders for support or inspiration.  Being
              one of those coders, feel free to reach out to me, @CodeHeeler, on
              Twitter where I share educational resources, interesting articles,
              and some of my own passions like linguistics and pixel art.
              <br><br>
              The goal is to develop a more in-depth resource guide and event
              calendar here in time, so stay tuned, and in the meanwhile, hit me
              up on Twitter anytime!

              One of the aims closest to my heart is sustainable agriculture,
              better known as Slow Food or the Local Food Movement.  I'm also a
              huge foodie and love encouraging others to experiment with world
              cuisine through food trucks, restaurants, and festivals.  Familiarity
              is key to helping newcomers to feel welcomed and comfortable, and
              websites or social media can be great gateways to know your farmer
              and support local businesses.  Unfortunately, I've found a number
              of my favorite farms and restaurants lack websites.
              <br><br>
              In order to share my coding skills to better my community, I will
              be offering to create simple websites for local farms, small
              businesses, and non-profits.  If you're interested in learning more,
              or even have a request for a coding project other than a website
              (basic inventory systems, or a database for tracking herd or crop
              information, etc), please email me, CodeHeeler, at gmail dot com.
              Also, if you're a coder yourself, please join me and offer to provide
              services in your own community!

              Being a passionate supporter of open source, I'm looking forward to
              becoming more involved in a number of projects worldwide.  From the
              gamified habit tracker, Habitica, to smaller projects asking for
              help on GitHub, my interests are varied and learning new things is
              a welcome challenge.  The difficulty is in getting started when
              others frequently are assigned an issue before you've had a chance
              to jump in.  Thankfully, there are newsletters and twitter feeds
              devoted to helping newcomers get acquainted with open source projects.
              <br><br>
              Check out my Twitter feed for some of these guides if you'd like to
              participate, and if you'd like to share projects I might not be aware
              of but could join, reach out to me on GitHub--I am CodeHeeler on either.
